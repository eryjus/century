Century is a Hobby OS.

I chose "Century" as a name for 2 reasons:
1) I am a bicyclist.  In fact, I am a road cyclist.  In the US, the bicycling version 
   of a marathon is called a century -- 100 miles at a time.  No, I have no aspirations
   to ride in the TDF.
2) I expect this OS to take at least 100 years to complete.

Since this OS will be available for others to review and possibly glean nuggets of 
information.  I do not represent this code as the ideal solution for anything.  If you 
have feedback for me, please feel free to e-mail me at hobbyos@eryjus.com.

As a result, I plan to provide smaller public commits to my public repository.
